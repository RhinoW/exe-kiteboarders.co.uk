## Join British Kitesports and Exe-Kiteboarders

* Join Exe-Kiteboarders via the [British Kitesports](https://www.britishkitesports.org/) (old name BKSA) - this provide a local and national voice for our sport.
* Associations and clubs carry a lot of clout at meetings with various authorities - they want to deal with well organised groups, not try and herd thousands of wild cats.
* Exe-Kiteboarders have represented Kite sports with various authorities over the years and there have been times when there has been a very real prospect of bans and restrictions being introduced.    
* British Kitesports set the standard for instruction in this country and many places worldwide and ensure those standards are kept up with regular re-certification.
* Membership of [**British Kitesports also provide insurance**](https://www.britishkitesports.org/join-british-kitesports/british-kitesports-association-insurance-policy/) that is highly recommended  wherever you go and is mandatory at some spots.
