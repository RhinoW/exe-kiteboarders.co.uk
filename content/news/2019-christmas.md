The Exe Kiteboarders club has been a little 'stealth' of late - but plenty has still been going on behind the scenes!

Now that we've got a new website up and running again it's time to let you know what we've been up to.

## New Website

This one! https://exe-kiteboarders.co.uk/

The [spot guides](/spot-guide/) will be useful especially for those new to the sport or the area and the [Weather](/weather/) page should be a nice timesaver as it has just about everything you need for the weather forcast and current wind conditons on one page.

## Facebook Group

Both Facebook groups for this area have been merged into one - [Exe Kiteboarders](https://www.facebook.com/groups/exmouthkitesurf/) - great for introducing yourself, discussions, getting advice and finding lost gear!

## Email newsletter

For anyone signed up via the [British Kitesports / BKSA](/membership) - another way of getting news out, don't worry it will be very occasional, no one needs more emails right!

## Harbour Master

In July Grahame Forshaw MBE was appointed Exeter Harbour Master with a responsibility that extends to the whole of the Exe Estuary and navigation channel. After the infamous 'dopes on ropes' comments made at an Exmouth Town Council meeting Ralph, Mike and Eric met with Grahame to discuss his concerns re: Safety. 

During a constructive meeting the club emphasised the sports history in this area and its good safety record,  the comprehensive code of conduct that all kitesurfers are asked to abide by and the clubs work with the Exe Water Users Group and the Exe Estuary Management Partnership re: the SSSI / wildlife refuge. 

## EXE Eastury Partnership

The start of the 'Duck Pond' Wildlife Refuge season (15th Sept to end of Dec) saw a number of incursions in to the area that caused concern.

The majority of kite-sufers are aware of the refuge but a small number, especially visiting kitesufers, are not yet. Efforts were made to chat to the few who were not aware and all agreed to keep out of the area now they know about it and of course the website's spot guide will help get this message out.

Several discussions have occured with the Exe Estuary Management Partnership and they are gratefull for the effforts the club has taken to 'get the word out' and have given us a write up in the [Exe Press" magazine](https://www.exe-estuary.org/exepress) (Issue 54, page 4) *** PIC ***

The season is nearly over but come next winter local kitesufers will again be encouraged to have a friendly chat with anyone who isn't yet aware of the area. The club is also looking at distributing printed 'spot guides' along with the Exe Water Users guide that was handed out around the duck pond this year.

## EXE Water Users Group

Ralph and Mike attended the Exe Water users Group's latest meeting mid November.

The Exe Estuary Managemnet Partnership (EEMP) reported that the Wildlife Refuge was working well with no real problems and very little incursion.

The RNLI raised concerns that some kites can get close to other craft and can be unaware of how threatening they can be. They made particular reference to getting too close to the All Weather Lifeboat on occasion, particularly whilst it was towing. The club agreed to redouble its efforts to ensure that kite sufers know to keep clear of other vessels using the Navigation Channel and to be aware that if a vessel is towing (lifeboats or ohers) the tow line may be hard to see and it would be very dangerous to the kitesufer to attempt to cross in between.
