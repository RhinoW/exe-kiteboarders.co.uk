## EDGE Watersports are hosting a Wing and Kite Demo Festival - SHRED FEST!!

<strong>16th-17th September at Sideshore, Exmouth</strong>

Over the weekend Edge will be doing free taster classes, team talks in the tent and on the water as much as possible!  

<em><strong>Exe Kiteboarders will have a stand </strong> - come chat to us about your ideas about what the club can do, find out what a harbour revision order is and what it could mean for our local spots and pick up spot guides and board stickers (to put your name/number on your board).</em>
