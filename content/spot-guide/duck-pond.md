title: "Duck Pond"
description: "Kitesurfing from Exmouth Duck Pond (Exe Estuary)"
---

The "Duck Pond" works best on a **North Westerly (NW)** wind - as the wind 'cleans up' as it funnels down Exe Estuary from Exeter. 

Its best **2 hours either side of High Tide**, but can be ridden at most states of the tide if you're willing to walk.

**The Duck Pond has a Wildlife Refuge area active from <span style="color:red">September through December</span> and it's vital we keep out of this area.**

## Location

The **Duck Pond** is the local name for part of the **Exe Estuary** nearest Exmouth.

The rigging / launch site is at the **Imperial Recreation Ground**, The Royale Ave, Exmouth, EX8 1DG.

Parking is sometimes tight right by the "Rec Ground" so there are alternatives a short walk away just over the road at the Imperial Road Short Stay Car Park that you passed getting there or across the Rec Ground grass at Camperdown Terrace - (EX8 1EJ)

## Hazards

* The Duck Pond area is shallow - a lot of it is waist deep at high tide but there are deeper areas.
* As the tide start going out you will find yourself in just a few inches.
* Being shallow can give a false sense of security sometimes. Most kitesurfing injuries are due to hitting 'stuff' and not in open water. On the water there are areas with sandbanks, buoys and boats (if nothing else these are great at tearing through expensive kites and lines). Around the sides there are concrete embankments, trees, signs, cars, *a train* and even sometimes a funfair.
* **The launch site is a particular hazard**, especially if its gusty and the grass is slippy and wet. If you're a beginner consider arriving early so you can setup and launch on the sand.
* Thats not to say it's a dangerous spot as it is great for beginners, but it does have hazards just like any other site.

## Wildlife Refuge
* The Exe Estuary is an important site for wildlife, including Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Protection Area (SPA). During winter, tens of thousands of birds depend upon the Exe to rest and feed on their long migratory journeys from areas as far away as Siberia.
* There are two Wildlife Refuges in operation - in pink on the map.
* The main one (for us) is to the East (town side) of the launch and is **active between 15th September and the 31st of December**
* There is also a permenant one around Dawlish Warren

* The **Exmouth Wildlife Refuge is marked out by a line of yellow buoys. Keep to the West of them** (to the left of them when looking up the estuary)

![Line of yellow buoys marking Exmouth Wildlife Area](/images/exmouth/duckpond-wildlife-refuge-buoys.jpg)
*(There are 4 big yellow buoys with numbers marking the powerboat course, ignore these - its the big yellow ones with crosses on and the smaller round ones all marked "WR")*

* Remember to turn well before them to ensure your kite doesn't overfly (they are both big and scary for birds and big and visible for photos showing proof that we're not abiding to the refuge!)
* If you do end up having to go into the refuge, despite your best efforts, for safety reasons or you have had some sort of fall or equipment failure then you will not be shot on sight. We must "Avoid wildlife refuges where safe to do so".
* If you spot other kite or wind surfers going into the Wildlife Refuge have a friendly word with them when safe to do so. No one wants to be the beach police, but its likely they just didn't know.
