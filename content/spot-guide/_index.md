Exmouth has two fantastic spots - the [Duck Pond](duck-pond) and the [Seafront](seafront) covering a wide range of wind and tide conditions.

Both have their own unique hazzards, restrictions and sensitivities so please read the detailed spot guides. 

If the conditions are kiteable there will almost ceretainly be others around so don't be afraid of introducing yourself to a local and asking for advice if you're new to this particular spot.

*Once you understand the spots, check the [Weather](/weather) page for tips on how to find out what's predicted and what's actually going on.*
