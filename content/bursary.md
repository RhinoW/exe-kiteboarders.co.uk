To celebrate the inclusion of **Kite Foil Racing in the 2024 Paris Olympics** and some of the incredible local Kitesurfing talent, the Exe Kiteboarders Club are offering a small bursary to young aspiring Olympians to help with ongoing equipment and training costs.

If you are 
* Local to Exmouth (i.e. consider Exmouth your local kitesurfing spot)
* Under 19 and are involved in one of the RYA/BKSA/EDGE Olympic pathway programs, such as Kite for Gold or Foiling Futures

Send an email to bursary@exe-kiteboarders.co.uk and tell us a bit about yourself, for example :-
* Where do you live & what school do you attend 
* What got you into the idea of Kite Foiling 
* What you've been up to so far re: Kite Foil Racing or training for it (e.g. any coaching programs or races you've competed in) 
* Who has been your biggest help and inspiration so far?

## Where does this money come from? ##

When you join [British Kiteboarding](/membership/) and select Exe Kiteboarders as your local club then part of your membership fee goes to Exe Kiteboarders. The club exists to represent Kite Sports with the various authorities in this area (there are a lot of stakeholders!) and a reserve is kept to fund any legal action should it be necessary. Funds above this reserve have used to :-

* Support various programs and events over the years
* Produce and distribute spot guides and equipment stickers
* Provide training and line knifes to the RNLI Lifeguards
* Donations to NCI and RNLI
* Social get-togethers (pre covid!) -->
