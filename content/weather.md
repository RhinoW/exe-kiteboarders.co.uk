There are two spots in Exmouth - the [Sea Front and Duck Pond](/spot-guide/) and the wind and tide conditions dictate which will be best at any particular time.

## Forecast
* [EDGE Watersports](https://www.edgewatersports.com/live-conditions/) - regularly  update a "Daily Report" and where and when is likely to be best depending on conditions and tide. Great for picking up not only when its good but also WHY so you can better understand weather (also on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/edgewatersports) )
* [Windguru - Exmouth](https://www.windguru.cz/47887)
* [Tide Times](https://www.tidetimes.org.uk/exmouth-dock-tide-times)
* [Magic Seaweed](https://magicseaweed.com/Exmouth-Surf-Report/164/)

## Live conditions

### Wind

* [Weather station in the middle of the Exe Estuary](https://www.windguru.cz/station/1882) - great live feed + history so you can see the trend
* [Exmouth Coastwatch](https://exmouthcoastwatch.co.uk/weather/) - under-reads if the wind has any North in it so check the Exe one above too. Can be offline and showing old data at times so check the error at the top - if it's showing red and "4 hours since last update". Click on the dials to see a history.
* [XC Weather](https://www.xcweather.co.uk/) - broader overview of the wind (actual and forecast) over the UK.

### Webcams - Seafront
