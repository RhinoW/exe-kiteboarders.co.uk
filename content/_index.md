# Exmouth, an Awesome Windsport Location

The seaside town of Exmouth has some of the best watersports locations in the country in the form of the [Duck Pond](spot-guide/duck-pond) (the Exe estuary) and the [Seafront](/spot-guide/seafront/) with its golden sands, awesome views and fantastic tidal conditions.

The two locations allow kite and wind surfing in a huge variety of conditions and wind directions. Kitesurfing in Exmouth has become massively successful. On a perfect day, we have seen over 100 kites on the water!

<strong>Safety and awareness are central to Exmouth's long-term future as one of the UK's best kiteboarding locations.</strong>
