Exmouth, an Awesome Windsport Location
The seaside town of Exmouth, the gateway to the Jurassic Coast, right opposite the legendary duckpond. We have some of the best watersports locations in the country in the form of the duckpond (the mouth of the exe estuary) and the seafront with its golden sands, awesome views and fantastic tidal conditions.

The two locations allow kite and wind surfing in a huge variety of conditions and wind directions.

Exmouth has many great places to stay and plenty of places to eat and drink, along with a couple of nightclubs, so whether you are just visiting us for the day or more everything you need is right here.

Kitesurfing in Exmouth has become massively successful. On a perfect day, we have seen over 100 kites on the water! The sport has been thriving in Exmouth since the first pioneers hit the water many years ago, and there has been an increasing number of riders enjoying the vast potential Exmouth has to offer.

Safety and awareness are central to Exmouth's long-term future as one of the UK's best kiteboarding locations and the founders of exe-kiteboarders are passionate about protecting their right to ride. If you are planning to visit Exmouth for your first tentative steps on the water or are already up and riding then please read and abide by the code of conduct, which has been developed in association with the Exe Estuary Management Partnership and is based on common sense and co-operation - fools will not be tolerated.
